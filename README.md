This game allows a player to play against the computer. Simply choose one of the five options and a winner will be displayed.

I have deployed this game to [heroku](http://play-rpsls.herokuapp.com) however you can also clone this repository and run it locally by doing the following:

`git clone https://github.com/costassarris/RPSLS`

`cd RPSLS`

`bundle install`

`rackup`

The game will now be ready to play locally by navigating to localhost:9292 in your brower.
